## Where can Docker help?
- Containers = abstracted application, including dependencies and configuration
- The *container* is the same where ever it runs
- Lightweight; can be deployed/rolled back fast and easily
- Isolation makes sure one container isn't affecting others
- Clear separation of concerns
